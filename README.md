It creates an additional page after successful username/password authentication that requires a 2nd Factor of Authentication using Duo Security (push, sms, call, hardware token code).

INSTALLATION
============
Install using Composer (https://getcomposer.org) from the root directory of your roundcube installation:

Run `$ composer require duosecurity/duo_api_php dev-master`

Run `$ composer require "lmr/duo_auth:>=1.0.7"`

Run `$ composer dumpautoload -o`

Run `cd plugins/duo_auth/`

Run `ln -s ../../vendor/duosecurity/duo_api_php/src/* .`

CONFIGURATION
=============
Copy `config.inc.php.dist` to `config.inc.php` and modify as necessary.
Enter all keys necessary for integration with Duo in the config.inc.php file.
Assuming a Duo integration has already been created in Duo's Admin Panel, you will be able to find all the information requested in the config.inc.php there.
